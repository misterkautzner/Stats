This project acts as a statistic organizer for a sports club (like hockey).  The user can create new players, seasons, games within seasons, and stats for players within a game. It automatically calculates a player's personal records as well as records per season, and does the same for the club in general.  It's a convenient tool for groups that want to track progress.

Technologies used:  Spring Framework, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Java, Hibernate, MySQL/H2, SQL, Thymeleaf, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS

I built this application because a hockey club, of which I am a member, was tracking player stats very inefficiently.  Season stats for each player were calculated by hand.  This should save countless hours of work down the road.

The project was originally wired to a MySQL database, but for easy-viewing purposes, it is currently connected to a H2 database which preloads semi-random data.  It takes a while to preload all of the data - I apologize.  The project needs quite a bit of data in order to demonstrate its significance.
